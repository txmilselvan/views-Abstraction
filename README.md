# views-Abstraction
# A view is a virtual table defined by a stored SELECT query. It doesn’t physically store data—it dynamically generates results from underlying tables whenever queried 

# Views simplify interaction with a database by presenting a clean, tailored interface—hiding complicated joins, filters, or calculations.

# They serve as reusable shortcuts: once defined, a view replaces complex SQL across applications and reports.

# If base tables evolve over time, views can absorb the changes, keeping consumer queries stable and consistent.

# Encapsulating business logic within views enforces a single source of truth, which helps maintain consistent data rules across systems.

# SQL views operate much like functions in programming—providing a clean, secure, and maintainable interface to data.

# Complexity & nesting ,While views can wrap other views, deep nesting might hinder query optimization and impact performance—use judiciously.
